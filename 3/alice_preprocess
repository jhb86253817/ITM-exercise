chapter i down the rabbitholealice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on thebank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into thebook her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations init and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures orconversationsso she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for thehot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasureof making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up andpicking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ranclose by herthere was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it sovery much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dearoh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards itoccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the timeit all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watchout of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried onalice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she hadnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watchto take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the fieldafter it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a largerabbithole under the hedgein another moment down went alice after it never once considering howin the world she was to get out againthe rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and thendipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deepwelleither the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wasgoing to happen next first she tried to look down and make out whatshe was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then shelooked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled withcupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictureshung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves asshe passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her greatdisappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fearof killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards asshe fell past itwell thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shallthink nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me athome why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the topof the house which was very likely truedown down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder howmany miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be gettingsomewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be fourthousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt severalthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though thiswas not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as therewas no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it overyes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitudeor longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was orlongitude either but thought they were nice grand words to saypresently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through theearth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk withtheir heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather gladthere was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all theright word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the countryis you know please maam is this new zealand or australia andshe tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre fallingthrough the air do you think you could manage it and what anignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do toask perhaps i shall see it written up somewheredown down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon begantalking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should thinkdinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk atteatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are nomice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats verylike a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alicebegan to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamysort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes dobats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either questionit didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozingoff and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand withdinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truthdid you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was overalice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a momentshe looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was anotherlong passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down itthere was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind andwas just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my earsand whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when sheturned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she foundherself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hangingfrom the roofthere were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and whenalice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying everydoor she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever toget out againsuddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solidglass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alicesfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hallbut alas either the locks were too large or the key was too smallbut at any rate it would not open any of them however on the secondtime round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried thelittle golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fittedalice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage notmuch larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passageinto the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out ofthat dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers andthose cool fountains but she could not even get her head through thedoorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice itwould be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i couldshut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to beginfor you see so many outoftheway things had happened latelythat alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were reallyimpossiblethere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she wentback to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or atany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes thistime she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not herebefore said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paperlabel with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in largelettersit was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice wasnot going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said andsee whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nicelittle histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wildbeasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not rememberthe simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhotpoker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut yourfinger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had neverforgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it isalmost certain to disagree with you sooner or laterhowever this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to tasteit and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavourof cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hotbuttered toast she very soon finished it off                                                                            what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like atelescopeand so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her facebrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for goingthrough the little door into that lovely garden first however shewaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any furthershe felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know saidalice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonderwhat i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of acandle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not rememberever having seen such a thingafter a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on goinginto the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to thedoor she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when shewent back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reachit she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried herbest to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slipperyand when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thingsat down and criedcome theres no use in crying like that said alice to herselfrather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generallygave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed itand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears intoher eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for havingcheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herselffor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two peoplebut its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two peoplewhy theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable personsoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the tableshe opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the wordseat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it saidalice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if itmakes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way illget into the garden and i dont care which happensshe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way whichway holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wasgrowing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the samesize to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alicehad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outofthewaythings to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go onin the common wayso she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
